Hello I'm Nicole 

**About Me**

Iâ€™ve been passionate about computer science since middle school, where I first explored coding with Scratch and Python, and that love only deepened in high school as I learned Java. Problem-solving is at the core of what I enjoy most; Iâ€™m driven to push my boundaries, learn new things, and take on fresh challenges. Recently, I started running, which led a friend to challenge me to tackle an 8K race. Instead of letting the pressure overwhelm me, I use it as a catalyst, breaking down tasks into manageable steps that help me stay focused, organized, and effectiveâ€”even in high-pressure situations.


 Debugging, often considered tedious, is one of my favorite aspects of coding; to me, itâ€™s like solving a puzzle where each adjustment brings me closer to a solution, and uncovering hidden issues is incredibly satisfying. This skill has also made me a valuable resource for my peers, as I frequently help them with their code. Whether Iâ€™m explaining assembly language concepts to classmates or assisting beginners in thinking like a programmer, I find that teaching not only strengthens my skills but deepens my understanding of concepts as well.

**Active member of WACM (Women in Computing)**, where I engage in seminars, tech talks, and learning events led by industry experts and business leaders. These experiences allow me to broaden my technical expertise, gain valuable insights from accomplished engineers, and build meaningful connections within the tech community. Listening to the journeys of successful women in technology not only inspires me but also reinforces my passion for software engineering and innovation. Their stories fuel my drive to contribute to a more inclusive, diverse, and forward-thinking industry.

***School Assignments***
In **Machine Organization and Programming**, I developed a **heap allocator in C**, implementing dynamic memory management with a best-fit allocation strategy. The allocator managed memory allocation and deallocation while maintaining block headers and footers to track size and allocation status. To optimize memory usage, I incorporated alignment adjustments and boundary tag coalescing, which allowed adjacent free blocks to merge, reducing fragmentation. Debugging segmentation faults and pointer arithmetic deepened my understanding of low-level memory operations, system calls, and data structures. This project strengthened my ability to write efficient, low-level code, reinforcing key concepts in memory management, operating systems, and performance optimization.

In ***CS 400***
N**BA Team Info Project**
â€¢ Designed and developed a **red-black tree** data structure for fast retrieval of NBA team information,
enhancing data query efficiency and user experience
â€¢ Collaborated on frontend and backend development, leading UI design and integrating backend logic to
deliver user-friendly application for both projects

***Airline CA Flight Paths Project*** 
â€¢ Engineered a Java-based application to calculate the shortest and cheapest airline routes between six major
U.S. airports using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for route optimization
â€¢ Parsed DOT files to extract and structure data, optimizing backend functionality while leveraging Linux and
Git to ensure efficient development and robust version control


High School Classes 

- Advanced Data Structures and Embedded Networking

   Throughout this course, I had the privilege to gain invaluable insights into the world of computer science by engaging in real- world scenarios. Each project was essentially a proposal that demanded teamwork and intricate coding skills to meet all the specified requirements. My passion lies in the realms of creativity and collaboration, and I firmly believe that these two qualities are the bedrock of remarkable innovations and effective problem-solving. Working within a team setting has not only sharpened my technical skills but also nurtured my ability to think creatively and bring fresh perspectives to the table.
