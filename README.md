Hello I'm Nicole 

**About Me**

Iâ€™ve been passionate about computer science since middle school, where I first explored coding with Scratch and Python, and that love only deepened in high school as I learned Java. Problem-solving is at the core of what I enjoy most; Iâ€™m driven to push my boundaries, learn new things, and take on fresh challenges. Recently, I started running, which led a friend to challenge me to tackle an 8K race. Instead of letting the pressure overwhelm me, I use it as a catalyst, breaking down tasks into manageable steps that help me stay focused, organized, and effectiveâ€”even in high-pressure situations.


Beyond coding fundamentals, my interests span UX design and DevOps, reflecting my enthusiasm for both creativity and collaboration. My strong eye for design began when I built a website for a small business on Wix. I also find DevOps compelling because of its emphasis on teamworkâ€”I love exchanging ideas, as I believe that shared insights drive creativity and progress. Debugging, often considered tedious, is one of my favorite aspects of coding; to me, itâ€™s like solving a puzzle where each adjustment brings me closer to a solution, and uncovering hidden issues is incredibly satisfying. This skill has also made me a valuable resource for my peers, as I frequently help them with their code. Whether Iâ€™m explaining assembly language concepts to classmates or assisting beginners in thinking like a programmer, I find that teaching not only strengthens my skills but deepens my understanding of concepts as well.



**Languages**

I am advanced in Java, and proficient in C++ and Python. 

**Current Job**

UW-Madison DoIT: 
Student Field Technologist

I provide general desktop support to numerous campus computers. I complete onboarding requests and set up new employees with their computers by re-imaging and deploying all needed software and personal information. I also go to people's offices to assist with their computer issues and set up monitors and all requested hardware.
