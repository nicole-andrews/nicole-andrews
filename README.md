Hello I'm Nicole 

**About Me**

I’m a Computer Science and Data Science student eager to create technology that truly makes a difference. I love problem-solving and debugging; to me, they’re like puzzles that sharpen my skills and push me to think outside the box.

I thrive on learning new languages, frameworks, and tools, and I’m always excited to explore emerging technologies that can improve the way people live, work, and connect.

With hands-on experience in front-end and back-end development, Agile collaboration, and a strong academic foundation with courses spanning user interfaces, operating systems, and big data systems, I bring both curiosity and determination to every project. I’m eager to dive deeper into the world of AI, building intelligent and ethical solutions that transform user experiences.

I also care deeply about the environment and the role technology plays in creating a sustainable future. I believe that as developers, we have both the power and the responsibility to build solutions that not only drive innovation but also respect and preserve our planet.

My goal is to grow as a developer while building innovative, reliable, and user-focused solutions that make a lasting impact.

I am advanced in JavaScript, Java and Python and proficient in C++, C, R, CSS, HTML, React.

**Jobs**

Software Development Internship at TASC
• Built new client-facing features in Angular (e.g., Client Profile page, Payment Plan Copy & Renewal flow)
designed mobile-first, with reusable components and faster load times.
• Enhanced user experience by going beyond ticket requirements — adding loading indicators, copy-to-
clipboard functionality, and performance improvements.
• Debugged complex issues using AWS CloudWatch logs and SQL, resolving urgent bugs before release
(e.g., API performance fix eliminating redundant endpoint calls, reducing load).
• Automated testing with Jasmine, Jest, and Cypress, updating fixtures and strengthening regression
coverage across large-scale repositories.
• Collaborated in an Agile/Scrum environment (sprint planning, reviews, daily standups), working cross-
functionally with business analysts, QA, and senior developers.
• Practiced clean coding in large repositories: refactoring, removing redundant code, and reusing existing
utilities to improve maintainability.

UW-Madison DoIT: 
Student Field Technologist
• Deployed and configured workstations with standardized software and security protocols, ensuring
compliance with organizational IT policies
• Identified and resolved system configuration issues during setup, ensuring functionality and reducing
downtime for end-users

**Active member of WACM (Women in Computing)**, where I engage in seminars, tech talks, and learning events led by industry experts and business leaders. These experiences allow me to broaden my technical expertise, gain valuable insights from accomplished engineers, and build meaningful connections within the tech community. Listening to the journeys of successful women in technology not only inspires me but also reinforces my passion for software engineering and innovation. Their stories fuel my drive to contribute to a more inclusive, diverse, and forward-thinking industry.

***School Assignments***
In **Machine Organization and Programming**, I developed a **heap allocator in C**, implementing dynamic memory management with a best-fit allocation strategy. The allocator managed memory allocation and deallocation while maintaining block headers and footers to track size and allocation status. To optimize memory usage, I incorporated alignment adjustments and boundary tag coalescing, which allowed adjacent free blocks to merge, reducing fragmentation. Debugging segmentation faults and pointer arithmetic deepened my understanding of low-level memory operations, system calls, and data structures. This project strengthened my ability to write efficient, low-level code, reinforcing key concepts in memory management, operating systems, and performance optimization.

In ***CS 400***
N**BA Team Info Project**
• Designed and developed a **red-black tree** data structure for fast retrieval of NBA team information,
enhancing data query efficiency and user experience
• Collaborated on frontend and backend development, leading UI design and integrating backend logic to
deliver user-friendly application for both projects

***Airline CA Flight Paths Project*** 
• Engineered a Java-based application to calculate the shortest and cheapest airline routes between six major
U.S. airports using Dijkstra’s Algorithm for route optimization
• Parsed DOT files to extract and structure data, optimizing backend functionality while leveraging Linux and
Git to ensure efficient development and robust version control


High School Classes 

- Advanced Data Structures and Embedded Networking

   Throughout this course, I had the privilege to gain invaluable insights into the world of computer science by engaging in real- world scenarios. Each project was essentially a proposal that demanded teamwork and intricate coding skills to meet all the specified requirements. My passion lies in the realms of creativity and collaboration, and I firmly believe that these two qualities are the bedrock of remarkable innovations and effective problem-solving. Working within a team setting has not only sharpened my technical skills but also nurtured my ability to think creatively and bring fresh perspectives to the table.
